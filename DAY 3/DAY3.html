			I don't know what to write here, so I'm just gonna copy a paragraph of lyrics from Hello. Hello, it's me. I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet to go over everything. They say that time's supposed to tell ya, but I ain't done much healing. Hello, can you hear me? I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be when we were younger and free. I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet. There's such a difference between us and a million miles. Hello from the other side. I must have called a thousand times to tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done. But when I call you never seem to be home. Hello from the outside. At least I can say that I've tried to tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart. But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore.

			Actually I am really terrified before coming to NYC. I was worried that I couldn't make friends. I was worried that I couldn't understand anything teachers would teach in the class. I was worried that I'll eat so much junk food and become so fat. But at least for now, so far so good.

		<p style="color: #FF99A0;">
			Anyway, I hope I can survive the whole thing.
