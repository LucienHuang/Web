			<span style="font-size:30px; color:white;">Light Up</span>
			<p>
				This is a project finished by 2 of my teammates and me. In this project, we made an iPhone application for Shanghai tourists and people to explore the city and to enjoy the culture. Users can light up the region they are at in the map and then share photos with others. In this way, users can see how much of the city they have explored, and where they haven’t been to.

			<p>
				People nowadays are more and more relying on smart phone in their daily lives and working situations. This is because smart phone has the features of portability, rich interactivity and its connectivity. Besides, since working and studying has been playing the most important role in our lives, now we have to deal with a great deal of various affairs. Scheduling time more appropriately is very essential to us. Therefore, an application that can manage our time and affairs, which should be easy to use and can meet a variety of our daily needs. However, after researching of schedule management applications that already exist, there are a few flaws that they generally suffer. Firstly, users tend to forget to add their affairs to the calendar, especially when they are too busy to go through the process which would make the scheduling applications completely useless. Secondly, those applications usually can be used without connecting to network. It seems that people are more encouraged to use the applications. However, I think this makes the applications fail to maximum the advantage of smart phone. Moreover, the affairs users can add to their calendar are usually based on time, which actually limits the types of affairs.

				This is a 3D game designed and developed by 2 of my teammates and me. This game was inspired by a classic game, Bomber Man. However, it’s a first person perspective game. The controlling mode is like Counter-Strike, and users can active cannons by clicking mouse. There are also AI robots and 3 different levels in the game.

			<p>
				This is a project finished by my teammates from Design College and me. The final product was a table with LED lights inside. And it’s off when there’s no plate on the table. But the lights will give out light in a set-up order when there’re plates on the table.
